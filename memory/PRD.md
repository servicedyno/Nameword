# Nameword Platform — Setup & Credential Audit (PRD / Handoff)

## Original Problem Statement
Extract and set up the app from https://github.com/Moxxcompany/NamewordProductionfixing on the Emergent pod using a provided `.env`, run it live, and identify + report dead credentials.

## Architecture (running in this pod)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + MongoDB (Mongoose), listens on port 8001 (supervisor `node bin/www`, dir `/app/backend`)
- **Frontend**: React 19 + Vite 7 + Tailwind v4, Vite dev server on port 3000 (`yarn dev --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000`)
- **DB**: local MongoDB `mongodb://localhost:27017/nameword` (Railway `DB_URI` is `*.railway.internal`, unreachable outside Railway)
- **Ingress**: `/api/*` -> backend 8001, everything else -> frontend 3000. Frontend calls `VITE_API_BASE_URL + /api/v1`.
- Preview URL: https://nameword-server.preview.emergentagent.com

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY FINDING — Malware removed
4 source files contained an injected, obfuscated self-executing payload (blockchain-based C2 "dead-drop resolver" that calls TronGrid for wallet `TMfKQEd7TJJa5xNZJZ2Lep838vrzrs7mAP` to fetch attacker-controlled next-stage commands):
- `backend/routes/index.js`
- `backend/routes/api/auth.js`
- `backend/routes/client.js`
- `backend/client/postcss.config.js`
The malware was stripped (legit code preserved). **All pasted credentials must be treated as COMPROMISED and rotated** — the same payload runs in the Railway production deployment.

## What was done (2026)
- Cloned repo, detected full-stack (backend + frontend), Node.js.
- Analyzed & removed injected malware from 4 files (verified clean).
- Configured `/app/backend/.env` and `/app/frontend/.env`, adapted URLs to pod, DB -> local Mongo.
- Removed `packageManager` (Corepack) field to install with classic yarn; installed backend + frontend deps.
- Rewrote supervisor to run Node backend (8001) + Vite frontend (3000). Seeded DB (tiers, badges, VPS/RDP/cPanel plans, OS, SSH-Admin).
- App verified live: homepage, /sign-in SPA route, backend `/api/v1` routing, Mongo connected.
- Live-tested all external credentials (see Credential Audit below).

## Credential Audit (live-tested)
ALIVE: Cloudflare (global key), Telegram bot (@BozznameStagingBot), APILayer Tax, Google OAuth (client id+secret), Sentry DSN, Zapier webhook.
DEAD: Brevo/SMTP (key not enabled) -> email broken; Twilio (auth token invalid); Telnyx (key not found) -> mobile OTP broken; OpenProvider (auth failed); ConnectReseller (APIKey invalid); FastForex (no active subscription/403); Google Service Account service-account.json (Invalid JWT Signature).
DEAD/UNREACHABLE (DNS NXDOMAIN, confirmed via Google+Cloudflare DoH): HostBay `api.hostbay.io`; DynoPay `api.dynopay.com` (JWT valid to 2027 but base URL dead + real host returns "Application not found" for company_id 39); WHM `*.privatehoster.cc`; Plesk `*.privatehost.su`.
EMPTY/not configured: UPCLOUD_USERNAME/PASSWORD, WHM_PASSWORD, GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID, GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID.

## Impact of dead credentials on flows
- Email verification / password reset: BROKEN (Brevo dead).
- Mobile OTP: BROKEN (Telnyx dead; Twilio fallback also dead).
- Domain search/register/transfer: BROKEN (OpenProvider + ConnectReseller + HostBay all dead).
- Payments / wallet top-up: BROKEN (DynoPay endpoint dead).
- Currency conversion: falls back to 1:1 (FastForex dead).
- Working: Google login (needs redirect-URI whitelisting for pod), Telegram login, Cloudflare DNS ops, tax rates, Sentry, Zapier.

## Backlog / Next Steps
- P0: Rotate ALL credentials (repo was backdoored).
- P0: Replace dead keys (Brevo, Telnyx, OpenProvider, ConnectReseller, DynoPay base URL, Google service account, FastForex) to restore flows.
- P1: Whitelist pod Google OAuth redirect URIs in Google Cloud Console.
- P2: Import production data from Railway Mongo if needed.
